Bank Account Manager is a small OOP designed program of different types of bank
 accounts (all based on the abstract Account.py class). Each type of account
 has a deposit and withdraw functions with a limit on both withdraw and deposit
  amounts.
The different accounts have a different interest rate set and they are all
managed using getters and setters.

The program an be managed using the main function under the ATM.py file which
prompts messages to the user as a real ATM will do.
